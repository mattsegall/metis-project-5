       "array([\"BLACKY THE CROW IS ALL PITY People who think that they are fooling others very often discover that they have been fooling themselves. Bowser the Hound. To have seen and heard Blacky the Crow as he talked to Reddy Fox, you would have thought that there was nothing under the sun in his heart or mind but pity. Yes, Sir, '' said he, I certainly would be tempted to show you where those fat hens are if you were not too weak. I just ca n't bear to see an old friend starve. It is too bad that those fat hens are so far away. I feel sure that one of them would make you quite yourself again. '' Do n't -- do n't talk about them, '' said Reddy feebly. If I could have just one fat hen that is all I would ask. Are they so very far from here? ''Blacky nodded his head vigorously. Yes, '' said he, they are a long way from here. They are such a long way that I 'm afraid you are too weak to make the journey. If you were quite yourself you could do it nicely, but for one in your condition it is, I fear, altogether too long a journey. '' It would n't do any harm to try it, perhaps, '' suggested Reddy, in a hesitating way. It is no worse to starve to death in one place than another, and I never was one to give up without trying. If you do n't mind showing me the way, Brother Blacky, I would at least like to try to reach that place where the fat hens are. Of course I can not keep up with you. In fact, I could n't if I were feeling well and strong. Perhaps you can tell me just how to find that place, and then I need n't bother you at all. ''Blacky pretended to be lost in thought while Reddy watched him anxiously. Finally Blacky spoke. It certainly makes my heart ache to see you in such a condition, Brother Reddy, '' said he. I tell you what I 'll do. You know Crows are famous for flying in a straight line when we want to get to any place in particular. I will fly straight towards that farm where the fat hens are. You follow along as best you can. In your feeble condition it will take you a long time to get anywhere near there. This will give me time to go hunt for my own dinner, and then I will come back until I meet you. After that, I will show you the way. Now I will start along and you follow. ''Reddy got to his feet as if it were hard work. Then Blacky spread his wings and started off, cawing encouragement. All the time inside he was laughing to think that Reddy Fox should think he had fooled him. He forgot to ask again if there is a dog there, '' chuckled Blacky to himself. As for Reddy, no sooner was Blacky well on his way than he started off at his swiftest pace. There was nothing weak or feeble in the way Reddy ran then. He was in a hurry to get to those fat hens. \"],\n",

       "array([\"SOME ONE FOOLS OLD JED THUMPER You can not judge a person 's temper by his size. There is more meanness in the head of a Weasel than in the whole of a Bear. Peter Rabbit. Old Jed Thumper sat in his bull-briar castle in the middle of the Old Pasture, scowling fiercely and muttering to himself. He was very angry, was Old Jed Thumper. He was so angry that presently he stopped muttering and began to chew rapidly on nothing at all but his temper, which is a way angry Rabbits have. The more he chewed his temper, the angrier he grew. He was big and stout and strong and gray. He had lived so long in the Old Pasture that he felt that it belonged to him and that no other Rabbit had any right there unless he said so. Yet here was a strange Rabbit who had had the impudence to come up from the Green Meadows and refused to be driven away. Such impudence!Of course it was Peter Rabbit of whom Old Jed Thumper was thinking. It was two days since he had caught a glimpse of Peter, but he knew that Peter was still in the Old Pasture, for he had found fresh tracks each day. That very morning he had visited his favorite feeding ground, only to find Peter 's tracks there. It had made him so angry that he had lost his appetite, and he had gone straight back to his bull-briar castle to think it over. At last Old Jed Thumper stopped chewing on his temper. He scowled more fiercely than ever and stamped the ground impatiently. I 'll hunt that fellow till I kill him, or drive him so far from the Old Pasture that he 'll never think of coming back. I certainly will! ''he said aloud, and started forth to hunt. Now it would have been better for the plans of Old Jed Thumper if he had kept them to himself instead of speaking aloud. Two dainty little ears heard what he said, and two soft, gentle eyes watched him leave the bull-briar castle. He started straight for the far corner of the Old Pasture where, although he did n't know it, Peter Rabbit had found a warm little sunning-bank. But he had n't gone far when, from way off in the opposite direction, he heard a sound that made him stop short and prick up his long ears to listen. There it was again -- thump, thump!He was just going to thump back an angry reply, when he thought better of it. If do that, '' thought he, I 'll only warn him, and he 'll run away, just as he has before. ''So instead, he turned and hurried in the direction from which the thumps had come, taking the greatest care to make no noise. Every few jumps he would stop to listen. Twice more he heard those thumps, and each time new rage filled his heart, and for a minute or two he chewed his temper. He 's down at my blueberry-patch, '' he muttered. At last he reached the blueberry-patch. Very softly he crept to a place where he could see and not be seen. No one was there. No, Sir, no one was there!He waited and watched, and there was n't a hair of Peter Rabbit to be seen. He was just getting ready to go look for Peter 's tracks when he heard that thump, thump again. This time it came from his favorite clover-patch where he never allowed even his favorite daughter, little Miss Fuzzytail, to go. Anger nearly choked him as he hurried in that direction. But when he got there, just as before no one was to be seen. So, all the morning long, Old Jed Thumper hurried from one place to another and never once caught sight of Peter Rabbit. Can you guess why?Well, the reason was that all the time Peter was stretched out on his warm sunning-bank getting the rest he so much needed. It was some one else who was fooling Old Jed Thumper. \"],\n",

       "array([\"What Happened to Prince Prigio in Town. By this time the prince was very hungry. The town was just three miles off; but he had such a royal appetite, that he did not like to waste it on bad cookery, and the people of the royal town were bad cooks. I wish I were in The Bear, ' at Gluckstein, '' said he to himself; for he remembered that there was a very good cook there. But, then, the town was twenty-one leagues away -- sixty-three long miles!No sooner had the prince said this, and taken just three steps, than he found himself at the door of the Bear Inn '' at Gluckstein! This is the most extraordinary dream, '' said he to himself; for he was far too clever, of course, to believe in seven-league boots. Yet he had a pair on at that very moment, and it was they which had carried him in three strides from the palace to Gluckstein!The truth is, that the prince, in looking about the palace for clothes, had found his way into that very old lumber-room where the magical gifts of the fairies had been thrown by his clever mother, who did not believe in them. But this, of course, the prince did not know. Now you should be told that seven-league boots only take those prodigious steps when you say you want to go a long distance. Otherwise they would be very inconvenient -- when you only want to cross the room, for example. Perhaps this has not been explained to you by your governess?Well, the prince walked into The Bear, '' and it seemed odd to him that nobody took any notice of him. And yet his face was as well known as that of any man in Pantouflia, for everybody had seen it, at least in pictures. He was so puzzled by not being attended to as usual, that he quite forgot to take off his cap. He sat down at the table, however, and shouted '' Kellner! ''at which all the waiters jumped, and looked round in every direction, but nobody came to him. At first he thought they were too busy, but presently another explanation occurred to him. The waiters: p38 The king, '' he said to himself, has threatened to execute anybody who speaks to me, or helps me in any way. Well, I do n't mean to starve in the midst of plenty, anyhow; here goes! ''The prince rose, and went to the table in the midst of the room, where a huge roast turkey had just been placed. He helped himself to half the breast, some sausages, chestnut stuffing, bread sauce, potatoes, and a bottle of red wine -- Burgundy. He then went back to a table in a corner, where he dined very well, nobody taking any notice of him. When he had finished, he sat watching the other people dining, and smoking his cigarette. As he was sitting thus, a very tall man, an officer in the uniform of the Guards, came in, and, walking straight to the prince 's table, said: Kellner, clean this table, and bring in the bill of fare. ''With these words, the officer sat down suddenly in the prince 's lap, as if he did not see him at all. He was a heavy man, and the prince, enraged at the insult, pushed him away and jumped to his feet. As he did so, his cap dropped off. The officer fell on his knees at once, crying: Pardon, my prince, pardon!I never saw you! ''This was more than the prince could be expected to believe. Nonsense!Count Frederick von Matterhorn, '' he said; you must be intoxicated. Sir!you have insulted your prince and your superior officer. Consider yourself under arrest!You shall be sent to a prison to-morrow. ''On this, the poor officer appealed piteously to everybody in the tavern. They all declared that they had not seen the prince, nor even had an idea that he was doing them the honour of being in the neighbourhood of their town. More and more offended, and convinced that there was a conspiracy to annoy and insult him, the prince shouted for the landlord, called for his bill, threw down his three pieces of gold without asking for change, and went into the street. It is a disgraceful conspiracy, '' he said. The king shall answer for this!I shall write to the newspapers at once! ''He was not put in a better temper by the way in which people hustled him in the street. They ran against him exactly as if they did not see him, and then staggered back in the greatest surprise, looking in every direction for the person they had jostled. In one of these encounters, the prince pushed so hard against a poor old beggar woman that she fell down. As he was usually most kind and polite, he pulled off his cap to beg her pardon, when, behold, the beggar woman gave one dreadful scream, and fainted!A crowd was collecting, and the prince, forgetting that he had thrown down all his money in the tavern, pulled out his purse. Then he remembered what he had done, and expected to find it empty; but, lo, there were three pieces of gold in it!Overcome with surprise, he thrust the money into the woman 's hand, and put on his cap again. In a moment the crowd, which had been staring at him, rushed away in every direction, with cries of terror, declaring that there was a magician in the town, and a fellow who could appear and disappear at pleasure! The crowd running: p42 By this time, you or I, or anyone who was not so extremely clever as Prince Prigio, would have understood what was the matter. He had put on, without knowing it, not only the seven-league boots, but the cap of darkness, and had taken Fortunatus 's purse, which could never be empty, however often you took all the money out. All those and many other delightful wares the fairies had given him at his christening, and the prince had found them in the dark garret. But the prince was so extremely wise, and learned, and scientific, that he did not believe in fairies, nor in fairy gifts. It is indigestion, '' he said to himself: those sausages were not of the best; and that Burgundy was extremely strong. Things are not as they appear. ''Here, as he was arguing with himself, he was nearly run over by a splendid carriage and six, the driver of which never took the slightest notice of him. Annoyed at this, the prince leaped up behind, threw down the two footmen, who made no resistance, and so was carried to the door of a magnificent palace. He was determined to challenge the gentleman who was in the carriage; but, noticing that he had a very beautiful young lady with him, whom he had never seen before, he followed them into the house, not wishing to alarm the girl, and meaning to speak to the gentleman when he found him alone. A great ball was going on; but, as usual, nobody took any notice of the prince. He walked among the guests, being careful not to jostle them, and listening to their conversation. It was all about himself!Everyone had heard of his disgrace, and almost everyone cried Serve him right! ''They said that the airs he gave himself were quite unendurable -- that nothing was more rude than to be always in the right -- that cleverness might be carried far too far -- that it was better even to be born stupid -LRB- Like the rest of you, '' thought the prince -RRB-; and, in fact, nobody had a good word for him. Yes, one had!It was the pretty lady of the carriage. I never could tell you how pretty she was. She was tall, with cheeks like white roses blushing: she had dark hair, and very large dark-grey eyes, and her face was the kindest in the world!The prince first thought how nice and good she looked, even before he thought how pretty she looked. She stood up for Prince Prigio when her partner would speak ill of him. She had never seen the prince, for she was but newly come to Pantouflia; but she declared that it was his misfortune, not his fault, to be so clever. And, then, think how hard they made him work at school!Besides, '' said this kind young lady, I hear he is extremely handsome, and very brave; and he has a good heart, for he was kind, I have heard, to a poor boy, and did all his examination papers for him, so that the boy passed first in everything. And now he is Minister for Education, though he ca n't do a line of Greek prose! ''The prince blushed at this, for he knew his conduct had not been honourable. But he at once fell over head and ears in love with the young lady, a thing he had never done in his life before, because -- he said -- women were so stupid! ''You see he was so clever!Now, at this very moment -- when the prince, all of a sudden, was as deep in love as if he had been the stupidest officer in the room -- an extraordinary thing happened!Something seemed to give a whirr!in his brain, and in one instant he knew all about it!He believed in fairies and fairy gifts, and understood that his cap was the cap of darkness, and his shoes the seven-league boots, and his purse the purse of Fortunatus!He had read about those things in historical books: but now he believed in them. \"],\n",
