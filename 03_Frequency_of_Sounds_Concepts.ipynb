To have seen and heard Blacky the Crow as he talked to Reddy Fox, you would have thought that there was nothing under the sun in his heart or mind but pity. Yes, Sir, '' said he, I certainly would be tempted to show you where those fat hens are if you were not too weak. I just ca n't bear to see an old friend starve. It is too bad that those fat hens are so far away. I feel sure that one of them would make you quite yourself again. '' Do n't -- do n't talk about them, '' said Reddy feebly. If I could have just one fat hen that is all I would ask. Are they so very far from here? ''Blacky nodded his head vigorously. Yes, '' said he, they are a long way from here. They are such a long way that I 'm afraid you are too weak to make the journey. If you were quite yourself you could do it nicely, but for one in your condition it is, I fear, altogether too long a journey. '' It would n't do any harm to try it, perhaps, '' suggested Reddy, in a hesitating way. It is no worse to starve to death in one place than another, and I never was one to give up without trying. If you do n't mind showing me the way, Brother Blacky, I would at least like to try to reach that place where the fat hens are. Of course I can not keep up with you. In fact, I could n't if I were feeling well and strong. Perhaps you can tell me just how to find that place, and then I need n't bother you at all. ''Blacky pretended to be lost in thought while Reddy watched him anxiously. Finally Blacky spoke. It certainly makes my heart ache to see you in such a condition, Brother Reddy, '' said he. I tell you what I 'll do. You know Crows are famous for flying in a straight line when we want to get to any place in particular. I will fly straight towards that farm where the fat hens are. You follow along as best you can. In your feeble condition it will take you a long time to get anywhere near there. This will give me time to go hunt for my own dinner, and then I will come back until I meet you. After that, I will show you the way. Now I will start along and you follow. ''Reddy got to his feet as if it were hard work. Then Blacky spread his wings and started off, cawing encouragement. All the time inside he was laughing to think that Reddy Fox should think he had fooled him. He forgot to ask again if there is a dog there, '' chuckled Blacky to himself. As for Reddy, no sooner was Blacky well on his way than he started off at his swiftest pace. There was nothing weak or feeble in the way Reddy ran then. He was in a hurry to get to those fat hens. \"],\n",

       "array([\"SOME ONE FOOLS OLD JED THUMPER You can not judge a person 's temper by his size. There is more meanness in the head of a Weasel than in the whole of a Bear. Peter Rabbit. Old Jed Thumper sat in his bull-briar castle in the middle of the Old Pasture, scowling fiercely and muttering to himself. He was very angry, was Old Jed Thumper. He was so angry that presently he stopped muttering and began to chew rapidly on nothing at all but his temper, which is a way angry Rabbits have. The more he chewed his temper, the angrier he grew. He was big and stout and strong and gray. He had lived so long in the Old Pasture that he felt that it belonged to him and that no other Rabbit had any right there unless he said so. Yet here was a strange Rabbit who had had the impudence to come up from the Green Meadows and refused to be driven away. Such impudence!Of course it was Peter Rabbit of whom Old Jed Thumper was thinking. It was two days since he had caught a glimpse of Peter, but he knew that Peter was still in the Old Pasture, for he had found fresh tracks each day. That very morning he had visited his favorite feeding ground, only to find Peter 's tracks there. It had made him so angry that he had lost his appetite, and he had gone straight back to his bull-briar castle to think it over. At last Old Jed Thumper stopped chewing on his temper. He scowled more fiercely than ever and stamped the ground impatiently. I 'll hunt that fellow till I kill him, or drive him so far from the Old Pasture that he 'll never think of coming back. I certainly will! ''he said aloud, and started forth to hunt. Now it would have been better for the plans of Old Jed Thumper if he had kept them to himself instead of speaking aloud. Two dainty little ears heard what he said, and two soft, gentle eyes watched him leave the bull-briar castle. He started straight for the far corner of the Old Pasture where, although he did n't know it, Peter Rabbit had found a warm little sunning-bank. But he had n't gone far when, from way off in the opposite direction, he heard a sound that made him stop short and prick up his long ears to listen. There it was again -- thump, thump!He was just going to thump back an angry reply, when he thought better of it. If do that, '' thought he, I 'll only warn him, and he 'll run away, just as he has before. ''So instead, he turned and hurried in the direction from which the thumps had come, taking the greatest care to make no noise. Every few jumps he would stop to listen. Twice more he heard those thumps, and each time new rage filled his heart, and for a minute or two he chewed his temper. He 's down at my blueberry-patch, '' he muttered. At last he reached the blueberry-patch. Very softly he crept to a place where he could see and not be seen. No one was there. No, Sir, no one was there!He waited and watched, and there was n't a hair of Peter Rabbit to be seen. He was just getting ready to go look for Peter 's tracks when he heard that thump, thump again. This time it came from his favorite clover-patch where he never allowed even his favorite daughter, little Miss Fuzzytail, to go. Anger nearly choked him as he hurried in that direction. But when he got there, just as before no one was to be seen. So, all the morning long, Old Jed Thumper hurried from one place to another and never once caught sight of Peter Rabbit. Can you guess why?Well, the reason was that all the time Peter was stretched out on his warm sunning-bank getting the rest he so much needed. It was some one else who was fooling Old Jed Thumper. \"],\n",
